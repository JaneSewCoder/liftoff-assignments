## Submission Instructions

Team Ryuhhnnâ€™s Liftoff Project

Overview:

Our group project will be a variation on a music event finder app.  There will be 3 main user focuses: concert goer, band manager (booking agent), venue. Each will be able to create a user profile with account details.
Similar to Ticketmaster, our app will allow a user (concert goer) to search for events based on location, genre, accessibility, and price.  When searching through events, the concert goer can review artist bio, view seating chart and other venue details and purchase tickets.  
The band manager/booking agent will be able to view venue details, location, nearby events, and load/accessibility options. Communication with venues for booking details will be available in a later version.
The venue profile will be able to access and update their venue details including seating chart, location, calendar of events, bar menu, drink specials. The venue will be able to promote events through the app (via boosting) as well as view ticket sales by month, year, date, and artist.
Users will find this app useful as a centralized app to find music specific events.  Our team came up with this idea via random idea generator on google. ðŸ˜Š

Projected Learnings:  
  There is an opportunity to be exposed to some javascript for front-end learning.    
  Additionally, I think learning to work in a group setting is a huge opportunity to 
  prepare for a real-world setting.

    Project is set up in GitHub and managed by our mentor.

2nd attempt: trying to figure out how to commit changes to my fork. ðŸ’¯
